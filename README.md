# 📊 California Housing Affordability Trends – Group Project

This repository presents a data-driven analysis of **homeownership and housing affordability trends in California**, focusing on the years **2017** and **2022**. The project was conducted as a collaborative group effort and combines data exploration, visualization, and policy analysis to understand the growing housing affordability crisis.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The core aim of this project is to:
- Investigate the **trends in housing affordability** over time.
- Examine **demographic disparities** in homeownership.
- Analyze the **factors that influence affordability**, such as income, rent, mortgage, and public assistance.
- Propose policy-driven solutions, such as wage subsidies through the **Housing Support Program (HSP)**.

## 🧩 Data Source

The analysis is based on data from the **American Community Survey (ACS)**, focusing on the years **2017 and 2022** for a comparative study.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Cleaned using **Excel**
- Created new features such as:
  - `Income Groups`: Categorized salary levels
  - `Percent Spent`: Monthly percentage of income spent on housing
  - `Multiracial`: Combination of “Other races” and “Two or more races” features

## 📈 Visualizations & Analysis

- 📊 **Excel**: Initial exploration and demographic trends
- 🐍 **Python**: Data analysis and affordability breakdown
- 📉 **Tableau**: Interactive storytelling on affordability and policy insights

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `cleaned_dataset.csv`: Final processed dataset
- `/excel_visuals/`: Excel-based charts and tables
- `/python_analysis/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis in Python
- `/tableau_visuals/`: Exports from Tableau dashboards
- `final_data_analyse_project.pptx`: Full project presentation
- `dictionnary and manual of the dataset`: User guide and dictionnary

## 🧠 Key Findings

- A **3.5% increase** in income spent on mortgages between 2017 and 2022
- Persistent **racial disparities** in housing affordability
- Over **65%** of Californians experience low-income conditions (based on food stamp data)

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The team proposed a **wage subsidy model** as part of the **CalWORKs Housing Support Program (HSP)** to support low-income workers and reduce housing instability.

## 🚧 Limitations & Future Work

- No machine learning implementation due to time constraints
- Additional cost-of-living factors (utilities, healthcare) were not included
